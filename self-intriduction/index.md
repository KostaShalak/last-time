Hi! 
My name is Constantine, and i from Belarus, Molodechno city. 
Today i study in Rolling Scope School, specializetione to junior frontend develepment.

So, how  did i get here?

For a long time I worked  a waiter in various restaurants and hotels in Minsk.

About my education:
I graduated from the Minsk State College of Arts.

During the pandemic, I want to switch profession. I started looking for information about programming.
Why programming, because in this profession you can work remotely with different countries, there are also many things for self-development. This profession will never let you get bored.
 
This is how I got introduced to HTML and CSS. In the process of getting acquainted with technologies, JavaScript also came, only for simple layout.

But time passed and I thought about where you can fully master this profession. So I started looking for courses, after a long search I found Rolling Scope School, where there is all the information about the profession.

Today my pet project is school tasks. 
Which are not as simple as they seem.

I hope my studies go well and my future learning path will be the Angular framework. You also need to improve your English in order to communicate with the world.

Thank you for your time, bye.
